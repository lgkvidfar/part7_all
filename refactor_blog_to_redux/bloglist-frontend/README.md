update 1:
recent: changed most fo state handling to redux
missing: error handling in redux, verifying only users can handle content (add, like, delete, etc), make it pretty, tests are totally outdated

update 2:
recent: continued state handling in redux, seperated current user from users
missing: A: page with list and info of users, B: verification for post handling, C: error handling (make it clearer), D: navigation, redirection and make things prettier

update 3:
recent: app is reduxed and bootstrapped
missing: app doesn't keep state after refresh.... also navigation post-action is not implemented (log in, add blog, add comment), also verification for post-handling and error handling  in redux is shite

update 4: 
recent: bootstrapped some more and some simple css for practice
missing: redux state lost efter refresh, verificationf or post handling and error handling inredxu. but I will leave this for now.










<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
